#  Android for Cars overview Stay organized with collections  Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

Bring your app to vehicles running either Android Auto or Android Automotive OS. Use one app architecture that works for both cases so every user can enjoy your app.

## Android Auto

Android Auto provides a driver-optimized app experience if you have a phone with the Android Auto app and a compatible [car or aftermarket stereo system](https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/). You can use your app directly on your car's display by connecting your phone. You enable Android Auto to connect with your phone app by creating services that Android Auto uses to display a driver-optimized interface to the driver. To learn more, see [Android Auto overview](/training/cars/platforms/android-auto).

**Note:** Android Auto is only compatible with phones running Android 9 (API level 28) and higher.

## Android Automotive OS

Android Automotive OS is an Android-based infotainment system that's built into vehicles. The car's system is a standalone Android-powered device that's optimized for driving. With Android Automotive OS, you install your app directly onto the car instead of your phone. To learn more, see [Android Automotive OS overview](/training/cars/platforms/automotive-os).

## Supported app categories

Due to considerations unique to cars, Android Auto and Android Automotive OS only support certain types of apps as described in the following table:

Category | Description | Platforms | Usage | Publishing  
---|---|---|---|---  
Media - audio |  Media apps let users browse and play music, radio, audiobooks, and other audio content in the car. See [Build media apps for cars](/training/cars/media) for more information.  **Important:** The Media category doesn't include video content - see the separate Video category for details on apps that play videos.  _Built using:_ `MediaBrowserService` and `MediaSession`. On Android Automotive OS, you can also build sign-in and settings screens (for use while parked) using Views or Compose.  Media apps can also be built using the [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps) templates, as a part of our [Early Access Program](https://goo.gle/Media-Comms-EAP) for Android Auto. See [Build a templated media app](/training/cars/apps/media) for additional information specific to media apps.  |  Android Auto and Android Automotive OS (for both media and templated media apps).  |  While driving or parked  |  All track types  **Important:** Media apps using Car App Library templates can only be published to Internal Testing tracks and Closed Testing tracks as a part of our [Early Access Program](https://goo.gle/Media-Comms-EAP)  
Communication - messaging notifications |  Messaging notifications let users receive incoming notifications, read messages aloud using text-to-speech, and send replies using voice input in the car. See [Extend messaging notifications for Android Auto](/training/cars/communication/notification-messaging) for more information.  _Built using_ : `MessagingStyle` notifications, a `Service` for handling reply and mark-as-read actions.  | Android Auto |  While driving or parked  |  All track types   
Communication - templated messaging labs |  Templated messaging apps expand upon the capabilities of messaging notifications to let users browse conversation history, read historical messages aloud using text-to-speech, and send replies using voice input in the car.  _Built using_ : The [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [ Build templated messaging experiences for Android Auto](/training/cars/communication/templated-messaging) for additional information specific to messaging apps.  | Android Auto |  While driving or parked  |  Internal Testing and Closed Testing tracks   
Communication - calling labs |  Calling apps let users make and receive calls on their car screen.  _Built using_ : The [ Telecom Jetpack Library](/develop/connectivity/telecom/voip-app) and the [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [ Build calling experiences for Android Auto](/training/cars/communication/calling) for additional information specific to calling apps.  | Android Auto |  While driving or parked  |  Internal Testing and Closed Testing tracks   
Navigation |  Navigation apps, including providers of driver and delivery services, help users get where they want to go by providing turn-by-turn directions.  _Built using_ : The [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [Build a navigation app](/training/cars/apps/navigation) for additional information specific to navigation apps.  | Android Auto and Android Automotive OS |  While driving or parked  |  All track types   
Point of Interest (POI) |  POI apps let the user discover and navigate to points of interest and take relevant actions, such as parking, charging, and fuel apps.  _Built using:_ The [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [Build a point of interest app](/training/cars/apps/poi) for additional information specific to POI apps.  | Android Auto and Android Automotive OS |  While driving or parked  |  All track types   
Internet of Things (IoT) |  IoT apps let you take relevant actions on connected devices from within the car. Examples include controlling the state of certain devices, such as opening a garage door, flipping home light switches, or enabling home security.  _Built using:_ The [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [Build an internet of things app](/training/cars/apps/iot) for additional information specific to IoT apps.  | Android Auto and Android Automotive OS |  While driving or parked  |  All track types   
Weather |  Weather apps let users see relevant weather information related to their current location or along their route. Weather apps can also provide navigation capabilities.  _Built using:_ The [Android for Cars App Library](/training/cars/apps). See [Build a weather app](/training/cars/apps/weather) for additional information specific to weather apps.  | Android Auto and Android Automotive OS |  While driving or parked  |  All track types   
Parked app categories  
Video |  Video apps let users view streaming videos while the car is parked. The core purpose of these apps is to display streaming videos.  _Built using:_ Views and/or Compose. See [Build video apps for Android Automotive OS](/training/cars/parked/video) for more information.  | Android Automotive OS |  Primarily while parked _Video apps can support limited use while driving as described in[Support audio while driving](/training/cars/parked/video#audio-while-driving). _ |  All track types   
Games labs |  Game apps let users play games while the car is parked. The core purpose of these apps is to play games.  _Built using:_ Views and/or Compose. See [Build games for cars](/training/cars/parked/games) for more information.  | Android Auto and Android Automotive OS |  Only while parked  |  Internal Testing and Closed Testing tracks   
Browsers labs |  Browser apps let users access web pages while the car is parked.  _Built using:_ Views and/or Compose. See [Build browsers for Android Automotive OS](/training/cars/parked/browser) for more information.  | Android Automotive OS |  Only while parked  |  Internal Testing tracks   
  
## Integrate with Google apps and services

You can build your own apps for use in vehicles that support [Android for Cars](/cars), including Android Auto and [cars with Google built-in](https://built-in.google/cars/). The following resources contain additional guidance relating to implementation:

  * Your app can launch navigation in Google Maps built-in through [Google Maps for Automotive intents](/training/cars/platforms/automotive-os/android-intents-automotive).

  * Navigation apps can achieve interoperability with Google Assistant through three different formats of intents. See [Implement navigation app intents](/develop/devices/assistant/intents-assistant-nav-app). To learn more about implementing turn-by-turn navigation apps compatible with Android Automotive OS and Android Auto, see [Build a Navigation app](/training/cars/apps/navigation#support-navigation-intents).

  * Google Assistant can launch any app that is installed in the vehicle with voice commands like _"Hey Google, open Example app."_

  * The [`PackageManager`](/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#getInstalledPackages\(android.content.pm.PackageManager.PackageInfoFlags\)) class lets you retrieve information about installed application packages on a device and then take further actions, such as getting the launchable intent for a package and launching that intent.




To test your apps, use the testing tools to run Android Auto and Android Automotive OS on your development machine. See [Test Android Apps for Cars](/training/cars/testing) for details.

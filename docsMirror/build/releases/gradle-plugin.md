## Variant API module opt-out

Starting with AGP 10, the new Variant API is mandatory for all projects. To support a gradual migration, you can temporarily opt specific modules out of this requirement before AGP 10 by applying the following to your `gradle.properties` file.
    
    
    android.newDsl.optOut=:example-lib1
    

## Strict 1:1 variant parity between dynamic feature and android apps

Starting in AGP 9.4, the build system checks for strict 1:1 flavor dimension parity between Android app modules and dynamic feature modules, reporting any missing, extra, or mismatched dimensions as build warnings. To help you prepare for stricter validation without breaking existing build pipelines, this check operates in warning mode by default, but can be promoted to an execution error by enabling the `android.enforceDynamicFeatureVariantMatching=true` Gradle option. From AGP 10.0 onwards, strict 1:1 variant parity will become enforced by default, turning all dimension mismatches between base apps and their dynamic feature modules into fatal build failures.

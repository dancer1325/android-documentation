#  Control your app from Macrobenchmark Save and categorize content based on your preferences. 

Unlike most Android UI tests, Macrobenchmark tests run in a separate process from the app itself. This is necessary to enable things like stopping the app process and compiling from DEX bytecode to machine code.

You can drive your app's state using the [UIAutomator library](/training/testing/ui-automator) or other mechanisms that can control the target app from the test process. To expose Compose elements to UI Automator, use `Modifier.testTag`.

**Note:** To let UI Automator map these tags to resource IDs, you must also set the `testTagsAsResourceId` semantics property to `true` on a parent composable.

The following example uses a `LazyColumn` with a `testTag`:
    
    
    @Composable
    fun ProductListScreen() {
        LazyColumn(
            modifier = Modifier
                .fillMaxSize()
                .testTag("my_lazy_column")    ) {
            items(100) { index ->
                ProductItem(index)
            }
        }
    }
    

The test uses the `testTag` to find the `LazyColumn` and fling it:
    
    
    @Test
    fun scrollList() {
        benchmarkRule.measureRepeated(
            packageName = "com.example.myapp",
            metrics = listOf(FrameTimingMetric()),
            iterations = 5,
            setupBlock = {
                uiAutomator {
                    pressHome()
                    startApp("com.example.myapp")
                }
            }
        ) {
            uiAutomator {
                // Find the Composable using its testTag mapped as a viewIdResourceName
                val lazyColumn = onElement { viewIdResourceName == "my_lazy_column" }
    
                // Fling the Compose list down
                repeat(3) {
                    lazyColumn.fling(Direction.DOWN)
                }
            }
        }
    }
    

Your benchmark doesn't have to scroll the UI. Instead, it can run an animation, for example. It also doesn't need to use UI Automator specifically. It collects performance metrics as long as frames are being produced.

**Note:** When accessing UI objects, specify the `packageName`, because the tests run in a separate process.

## Navigate to deep composable destinations

Sometimes you might want to benchmark a specific screen that isn't immediately visible when the app starts, like a details screen or a checkout page deep within your Jetpack Navigation graph.

Because Macrobenchmark runs out-of-process, you can't interact directly with your `NavController` to swap screens. Instead, your benchmark must simulate a user navigating to that part of the app.

Use the `setupBlock` to handle the preparation steps, like clicking through an onboarding flow or a menu button. This way, your `measureBlock` captures the performance metrics of only the target screen.
    
    
    @Test
    fun deepScreenScrollList() {
        benchmarkRule.measureRepeated(
            packageName = "com.example.myapp",
            metrics = listOf(FrameTimingMetric()),
            iterations = 5,
            setupBlock = {
                uiAutomator {
                    // 1. Start the app on the home screen
                    startApp("com.example.myapp")
    
                    // 2. Navigate to the internal screen by clicking a Compose component
                    // (e.g., a card that opens the target list view)
                    val settingsButton = onElement { viewIdResourceName == "go_to_list_button" }
                    settingsButton.click()
    
                    // 3. Wait until the target screen settles and is fully rendered
                    waitForStableInActiveWindow()
                }
            }
        ) {
            uiAutomator {
                // The actual benchmark measurement starts here on the target screen
                val lazyColumn = onElement { viewIdResourceName == "my_lazy_column" }
                lazyColumn.fling(Direction.DOWN)
            }
        }
    }

The following pages provide information about improving your app's use of memory.

## General memory guidance

[Memory overview](/topic/performance/memory-overview)
    Explains core Android memory architecture, RAM constraints, and how the operating system balances processes using the Low Memory Killer (LMK).
[Memory management](/topic/performance/memory/manage-app-memory)
    Outlines developer best practices for releasing resources across component lifecycles, avoiding leaks, and managing memory when transitioning between process states.
[Understanding and troubleshooting Android memory](/topic/performance/memory/guide)
    Provides a comprehensive overview of Android memory architecture, the tools available for analysis, and practical exercises to help you identify and resolve memory-related issues.
[Set app memory budgets](/topic/performance/memory/app-memory-budgets)
    Explains how to declare and manage application memory budgets to trim memory usage down to your app's active working set.

## Area-specific optimizations

[Games memory overview](/games/optimize/memory-overview)
    Details memory budgeting, native allocation handling, and graphic asset management guidance tailored specifically for apps using game engines.
[Optimizing bitmap images](/develop/ui/compose/graphics/images/optimization)
    Demonstrates how to size, decode, and cache bitmap assets efficiently within image libraries.
[Manage and diagnose WebView memory](/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/manage-webview-memory)
    Explains the WebView multi-process memory model, describes how to properly manage its lifecycle to prevent leaks, and provides practical workflows for diagnosing memory issues.
[R8 code optimization](/topic/performance/app-optimization/enable-app-optimization)
    Explains how to use R8 to reduce APK size, metadata overhead, and runtime memory consumption.

## Local memory debug tools

[Android Studio tools](/studio/profile)
    Provides real-time heap inspection, memory allocation tracking, and leak detection workflows directly inside the IDE.
[Perfetto Heap Dump Explorer](https://perfetto.dev/docs/visualization/heap-dump-explorer)
    Offers deep visual analysis of native and Java or Kotlin heap dumps to isolate retained object trees and anonymous memory allocations.
[Capture a system trace on device](/topic/performance/tracing/on-device)
    Shows how to record on-device system-level traces to address performance-related bugs in your app.
[Debugging memory usage on Android](https://perfetto.dev/docs/case-studies/memory)
    Teaches how to understand Linux memory management and use tools like `dumpsys meminfo`, Perfetto, native heap profiles, and heap dumps to track memory usage and identify leaks.

## Production-level memory tools

[Android vitals: Memory usage (anonymous RSS + swap)](/google/play/vitals/memory-usage)
    Android vitals shares your app's production memory usage broken down by the process states foreground, foreground service, and background service.
[Android vitals: Bitmap memory usage](/google/play/vitals/bitmap-memory-usage)
    Android vitals provides metrics on an app's bitmap memory footprint by aggregating data from Android devices.
[Android vitals: DEX code optimization](/google/play/vitals/code-optimization)
    Android vitals can alert you when your app's DEX code optimization levels are low. This includes obfuscation, shrinking, and optimization for apps and games that use R8.
[Crashlytics 20.1.0](https://firebase.google.com/support/release-notes/android#crashlytics_v20-1-0)
    Displays production out-of-memory (OOM) exceptions and memory limiter kills with diagnostic context to prioritize and fix field crashes.
[ProfilingManager](/topic/performance/tracing/profiling-manager/overview)
    Advanced API that lets apps programmatically collect and upload production heap dumps and heap profiles from live user sessions.

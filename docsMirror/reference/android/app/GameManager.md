# GameManager

* * *

[Kotlin](/reference/kotlin/android/app/GameManager "View this page in Kotlin") |Java

` public final class GameManager `   
` extends [Object](/reference/java/lang/Object) ` ` `

[java.lang.Object](/reference/java/lang/Object)  
---  
↳ | android.app.GameManager   
  


* * *

The GameManager allows system apps to modify and query the game mode of apps. 

**Note:** After `[Build.VERSION_CODES.VANILLA_ICE_CREAM](/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#VANILLA_ICE_CREAM)`, some devices that do not support the GameManager features _may_ not publish a GameManager instance. These device types include: 

  * Wear devices (`[PackageManager.FEATURE_WATCH](/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager#FEATURE_WATCH)`) 



Therefore, you should always do a `null` check on the return value of `[Context.getSystemService(Class)](/reference/android/content/Context#getSystemService\(java.lang.Class<T>\))` and `[Context.getSystemService(String)](/reference/android/content/Context#getSystemService\(java.lang.String\))` when trying to obtain an instance of GameManager on the aforementioned device types.

## Constants

### GAME_MODE_BATTERY

Added in [API level 31](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public static final int GAME_MODE_BATTERY

Battery game mode will save battery and give longer game play time.

Constant Value: 3 (0x00000003) 

### GAME_MODE_CUSTOM

Added in [API level 34](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public static final int GAME_MODE_CUSTOM

Custom game mode that has user-provided configuration overrides. 

Custom game mode is expected to be handled only by the platform using users' preferred config. It is currently not allowed to opt in custom mode in game mode XML file nor expected to perform app-based optimizations when activated.

Constant Value: 4 (0x00000004) 

### GAME_MODE_PERFORMANCE

Added in [API level 31](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public static final int GAME_MODE_PERFORMANCE

Performance game mode maximizes the game's performance. 

This game mode is highly likely to increase battery consumption.

Constant Value: 2 (0x00000002) 

### GAME_MODE_STANDARD

Added in [API level 31](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public static final int GAME_MODE_STANDARD

Standard game mode means the platform will use the game's default performance characteristics.

Constant Value: 1 (0x00000001) 

### GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED

Added in [API level 31](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public static final int GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED

Game mode is not supported for this application.

Constant Value: 0 (0x00000000) 

## Public methods

### getGameMode

Added in [API level 31](/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element#ApiLevels)
    
    
    public int getGameMode ()

Return the user selected game mode for this application. 

An application can use `android:isGame="true"` or `android:appCategory="game"` to indicate that the application is a game. If an application is not a game, always return `[GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED)`. 

Developers should call this API every time the application is resumed. 

If a game's `targetSdkVersion` is `[Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU](/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#TIRAMISU)` or lower, and when the game mode is set to `[GAME_MODE_CUSTOM](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_CUSTOM)` which is available in `[Build.VERSION_CODES.UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE](/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES#UPSIDE_DOWN_CAKE)` or newer, this API will return `[GAME_MODE_STANDARD](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_STANDARD)` instead for backward compatibility.

Returns  
---  
`int` | Value is one of the following: 

  * `[GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_UNSUPPORTED)`
  * `[GAME_MODE_STANDARD](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_STANDARD)`
  * `[GAME_MODE_PERFORMANCE](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_PERFORMANCE)`
  * `[GAME_MODE_BATTERY](/reference/android/app/GameManager#GAME_MODE_BATTERY)`

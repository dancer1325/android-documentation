* goal
  * ðŸ’¡Compose's declarative approach != View-based approachðŸ’¡

* declarative API
  * -- provided by -- Jetpack Compose
  * allows
    * rendering your app UI / WITHOUT mutating FE views

* declarative UI model
  * makes easier
    * build UI
    * update UI 
      * != manually update a stateful view hierarchy 
  * how does it work?
    * regenerate the entire screen -- from -- scratch / apply ONLY the necessary changes
      * cons
        * potentially expensive (about computing power, and battery usage) -> ONLY applied | NECESSARY parts 

* Composable functions
  * emit UI hierarchy -- by calling -- OTHER composable functions
    * BUT WITHOUT returning anything -- Reason: ðŸ§ declarative UI model ðŸ§  --

* Android view hierarchy
  * == tree of UI widgets
    * is updated -- based on -- changes of state of the app (_Example:_ user interactions) / display the current data 
    * legacy view approach
      * if you want to update the widgets
        * steps
          * walk the tree -- via -- `findViewById()`
          * change nodes -- via -- `button.setText(String)`, `container.addChild(View)`, or `img.setImageBitmap(Bitmap)` 
        * error prone 
          * as MORE views -> MORE likelihood to errors 
          * _Examples:_
            * _Example1:_ if a piece of data is rendered | multiple places -> you need to update ALL == easy to forget to update one 
            * _Example2:_ if 2 updates conflict in an unexpected way -> create illegal states  
            * _Example3:_ set a value of a node / was just removed | UI
      * == imperative object-oriented UI toolkit
        * if you want to initialize the UI -> instantiate a tree of widgets
          * -- via -- inflating an XML layout file
          * / EACH widget
            * maintains its own internal state
            * exposes getter and setter methods -- to interact with the -- widget
    * Compose's declarative approach
      * widgets
        * relatively stateless
        * NOT expose setter or getter functions
          * widgets are NOT exposed as objects
      * if you want to update the widgets
        * call the SAME composable function -- with -- DIFFERENT arguments 
          * == easy to provide state to architectural patterns -- _Example:_ `ViewModel` --
        * | ANY time the observable data updates -> your composables -- are responsible, for -- transforming the current application state -- into a -> UI
      * way to populate with data your app
        * app logic -- provides data to the -- top-level composable function
        * those top-level composable functions -- passes the -- appropriate data | those composables & down the hierarchy
        
        ![](images/develop.ui.compose.mental-model.1.png)
      * way the user -- interacts with the -- UI
        * UI raises events -- _Example:_ `onClick` --
        * Those events -- should notify the -- app logic / change the app's state
        * WHEN the state changes -> the composable functions -- are called again with the -- NEW data
          * -> UI elements are redrawn -- recomposition process --

* Dynamic Content
  * available | Compose approach (NOT | View-approach)
    * Reason: ðŸ§  written in Kotlin ðŸ§ 
  * _Example:_ `ThinkingInComposeSnippets.kt`

* recomposition
  * | imperative UI model
    * if you want to change a widget (== change its internal state) -> call a setter | widget
  * | Compose
    * ðŸ‘€if you want to change a widget -> call the composable function AGAIN -- with -- NEW data == recomposition ðŸ‘€
      * ðŸ’¡== function is recomposedðŸ’¡
        * if necessary -> widgets / emitted by the function & ONLY those / changed, -- are redrawn with -- NEW data
      * "AGAIN" == as often as EVERY frame
      * _Example:_ `ThinkingInComposeSnippets.kt`
      * ðŸ‘€execute composable functions
        * -- NEVER depend on -- side-effectsðŸ‘€ 
          * Reason: ðŸ§  function's recomposition -- may be -- skipped ðŸ§  
          * if you do -> users -- may experience -- strange & unpredictable behavior | your app
          * _Example:_ dangerous side-effects
            * write to a shared object's property 
            * update
              * ViewModel's observable 
              * shared preferences
        * should be fast
          * Reason: ðŸ§ avoid jankðŸ§ 
          * if you need to do expensive operations (_Example:_ `ThinkingInComposeSnippets.kt`) ->
            * do it | background coroutine
            * pass the value result -- to the -- composable function's parameter
    * recomposition
      * skips as MANY composable functions and lambdas as POSSIBLE
        * TODO:
      * is optimistic and MAY be canceled
        * TODO:
    * composable functions
      * MIGHT be run quite FREQUENTLY (as often as EVERY frame of an animation)
        * TODO:
      * can execute in
        * parallel
          * TODO:
        * ANY order

  * Views
    * describe your UI look step by step
      * steps
        * define them -- via -- .xml
        * if user interacts with your view -> 
          * find Views -- from -- code
          * specify the behavior | your UI -- via -- `setter()`
    * cons
      * handle manually update Views is error prone
        * Reason: ðŸ§ you can forget to update a View ðŸ§ 
  * Compose
    * how does UI components work?
      * declare what you want
      * if screen needs to change -> redeclare ALL what you want
    * UI elements
      * == functions
      * != objects
        * -> you can NOT
          * find reference to them or
          * call methods -- to -- mutate
    * State and events in Compose
      * TODO:
  * Views vs Compose
    * ðŸ’¡construct UI from how (| View) -> what (| Compose)ðŸ’¡
    * way to define UI elements
      * xml | View vs Kotlin | Compose
